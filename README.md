# [Euler Problem 6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6) in Brainfuck

Completed as part of the Esoteric Programming Languages DeCal at UC Berkeley.

Not optimized, but it works for Brainfuck with 32-bit register support.
Couldn't get 8-bit working properly with conversions, but that's for another day.

## Usage

You can run the code here: https://copy.sh/brainfuck/?file=https://jasmangle.github.io/bf-euler6/euler6-32b.bf

Be sure to enable 32-bit registers prior to running the program.
